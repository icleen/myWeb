<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Iain Lee!</p>

<h2>About:</h2>

<p>
    I am currently a student at BYU studying computer science.
    My emphasis is on machine learning, which I have been
    studying in class and on my own for about 8 months now.
    I will graduate in December 2018, after which I plan to
    persue a PhD in computer science.
    In my spare time I love to rock climb, bike, backpack,
    or whatever else lets me spend time in nature.
