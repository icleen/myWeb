<h2>Projects:</h2>

<p>
    My current research is focused on the 1940 U.S.
    census.  The goal of my team is to be able to read
    in a page from the census and automatically draw
    information from it.  This allows the documents to
    be searchable, which is helpful for people trying to
    do family history research.  It also allows us to draw
    a lot of data that economists and historians can use to
    learn generalities about American citizens during that
    time period.
    Another project I worked on was training a neural
    network to recognize Japanese Characters (kanji).  In
    the end I was able to get about 96% accuracy on the data
    set I was using, which is pretty good.
    I also worked on a document view tool.  In most Asian
    countries they have pedigree charts for each family name
    that can stretch back hundreds of years.  They are
    structured so you can easily see the family hierarchy.
    The tool I worked on made use of that structure and
    displayed those documents in a format so that you could
    see the hierarchy clearly.
