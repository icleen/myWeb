      My current research is focused on the 1940 U.S.
      census.  The goal of my team is to be able to read
      in a page from the census and automatically draw
      information from it.  This allows the documents to
      be searchable, which is helpful for people trying to
      do family history research.  It also allows us to draw
      a lot of data that economists and historians can use to
      learn generalities about American citizens during that
      time period.
      Another project I worked on was training a neural
      network to recognize Japanese Characters (kanji).  In
      the end I was able to get about 96% accuracy on the data
      set I was using, which is pretty good.
      I also worked on a document view tool.  In most Asian
      countries they have pedigree charts for each family name
      that can stretch back hundreds of years.  They are
      structured so you can easily see the family hierarchy.
      The tool I worked on made use of that structure and
      displayed those documents in a format so that you could
      see the hierarchy clearly.
